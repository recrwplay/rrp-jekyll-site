Record Rewind Play is a music blog, and my personal quest to write about the best new releases, the most exciting new artists, and to combine all those with the best of everything that I’ve listened to, from the pop music of my early years to whatever happens to catch my ear now, whether it's indie-pop or minimalist electronica.

There’s just me here, and my writing schedule can be erratic, but I try to post at least one track every day, with album reviews either wedged in from time to time or written in one crazy day of effort that I call <span class="track-title">'One Band One Day'</span>.

So where did this love of music come from?

## About Me

I blame <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/r-e-m/" title="See all posts about R.E.M." rel="bookmark" class="title-link">R.E.M.</a></span> you know. Specifically, I blame them for releasing <span class="album-title">Out of Time</span> in 1991, and for releasing <span class="track-title">'Losing My Religion'</span> as a single. I blame them for creating something that had a hold on me like no music had quite managed before. And by <span class="track-title">'blame'</span>, I really mean <span class="track-title">'thank'</span>.

I had loved various pop musics through the 1980s: I had experienced strange dreams about visiting <span class="artist-name">Shakin’ Stevens</span> in his semi-detached suburban home; I had recorded many a Sunday evening broadcast of the Top 40 (and therefore also listened, bewildered, through the last few moments of many a broadcast of <span class="track-title">'Sing Something Simple'</span>); I had been given Now! compilations; I had copied whole albums by the likes of <span class="artist-name">Eurythmics</span> and <span class="artist-name">Simply Red</span>.

I hadn’t quite found my niche, however. And I didn’t quite find it first time after <span class="album-title">Out of Time</span>. Having used the summer to catch up on the R.E.M. back catalogue, and so, finding there was much more to be loved than just that Athens quartet, I spent some birthday money on a trio of albums that while not exactly the past, present and future of my listening habits, are at least a close enough approximation.

From the past, came <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/dire-straits/" title="See all posts about Dire Straits" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Dire Straits</a></span>, who had just released <span class="album-title">On Every Street</span>, the long-awaited successor to multi-multi-million seller <span class="album-title">Brothers in Arms</span>. I’d listened to a bit of Dire Straits growing up, and liked them enough to have once forked out some hard-earned pocket money on their live double LP <span class="album-title">Alchemy</span>. <span class="album-title">On Every Street</span> turned out to be a bit of a disappointment, leaving me feeling that their time, and my time with them, had passed. I still have a soft spot for the long, slow build up and extended outro of the title track, though.

Representing the present, the middle ground, was <span class="artist-name">Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers</span>. I mostly bought <span class="album-title">Into the Great Wide Open</span> on the strength of <span class="track-title">'Learning to Fly'</span>, and it has always been my favourite track on an album that otherwise felt too flat and samey. Again, it just didn&#8217;t have the spark I was looking for, or the sense of independence.



But what of the future? Well, holding the mic for music still to come was a young band with an album that older and more cynical heads might have felt was trying to too hard to surf too many indie genres in order to get itself noticed. To me &#8211; younger, more naive &#8211; <span class="album-title">Leisure</span> by <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/blur/" title="See all posts about Blur" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Blur</a></span> was the sound of things to come. Here was the guitar sound, the mood that I was looking for.



After that I discovered shoegazing, baggy and indie pop. A friend introduced me to <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/nick-drake/" title="See all posts about Nick Drake" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Nick Drake</a></span> and I fell in love. I found <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/neil-young/" title="See all posts about Neil Young" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Neil Young</a></span>, possibly by way of <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/saint-etienne/" title="See all posts about Saint Etienne" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Saint Etienne</a></span>. I bought monthlies and inkies and collected their free cassettes. I recorded the Evening Session and John Peel. I stopped caring about the Top 40 and celebrated the indie charts instead.

And then, I suppose, there was Britpop, much maligned but really never so bad as some of the retrospective despair would have you believe. As Britpop begat a slew of new British indie bands, I looked west towards artists like <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/lambchop/" title="See all posts about Lambchop" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Lambchop</a></span>, <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/ryan-adams/" title="See all posts about Ryan Adams" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Ryan Adams</a></span> and <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/wilco/" title="See all posts about Wilco" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Wilco</a></span>, for new millennium inspiration.

And now?

Well, perhaps the best answer to that question is to point you at my end of end-of-year round-up for 2013. There you&#8217;ll find stalwarts like <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/suede/" title="See all posts about Suede" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Suede</a></span> and <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/pulp/" title="See all posts about Pulp" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Pulp</a></span> rubbing shoulders with new kids on the block (but not <span class="artist-name">New Kids on the Block</span>) like <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/chvrches/" title="See all posts about Chvrches" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Chvrches</a></span> and <span class="artist-name"><a href="http://www.recordrewindplay.co.uk/artist/speedy-ortiz/" title="See all posts about Speedy Ortiz" rel="bookmark" class="title-link">Speedy Ortiz</a></span>. I&#8217;ve learned to love synths, electronica and minimalism, but I haven’t yet stopped loving the old heroes.
